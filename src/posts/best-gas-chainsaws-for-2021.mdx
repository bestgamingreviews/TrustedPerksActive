  Gas chainsaws are a must-have tool for professional lumberjacks, landscapers,
  and DIY gardeners. Compared to electric chainsaws or cordless chainsaws,
  gasoline-powered ones are more powerful and efficient in terms of run time,
  cutting speed, and mobility.


  Some gas chainsaws are suitable for heavy-duty tasks like felling and bucking large trees. While some are more maneuverable so they are suitable for pruning and trimming.


  To choose the best gas chainsaw, you need to consider certain factors. Some of them are mentioned below...


  * Guide bar or blade length - The length of the blade and chain determines the thickness of the piece of wood that the chainsaw can cut. Chainsaw blade lengths range from 12 to 17 inches. For residential purposes or casual lumberjacks, 30-50cm is suitable. For professional quality work and heavy-duty work, we recommend going for 20 inches or more.

  * Engine Size / Power - A large engine means it has more power to handle any task. The small motors are easier to move, making them perfect for pruning and trimming. To know the motor power, you need to check the DC rating or motor capacity. For simpler tasks, 24cc to 46cc is suitable. For heavy-duty, you can opt for a 60cc engine.
    GreenWorks 20362 is the power of a chainsaw with enough grunts to handle the most demanding tasks. It frequently gets high marks on chainsaw rating sites, it's the perfect saw for if you have a large yard or property and regularly need to do a lot of cleaning work.

  We have mentioned a detailed guide on the length of the bar, the motor, and the tasks they can perform in our Buying Guide. It also has other information such as anti-vibration function, safety functions, throttle, kickback, and warranty. Please read it carefully to make an informed decision.

  ### Best Gas Chainsaw & Buying Guide


  Now that we've covered how some of the most important features of chainsaw work, as the list mentioned above- best gas chainsaws.


  What I tried to do in these gas chainsaw detailed information is recommend a high-quality tool for each person's needs.


  What you will find below is a detailed list of the best chainsaws for each guide bar and size chain. I'll start small at 12 inches and work my way up to the longest 24-inch semi-professional gas chainsaw.


  Some of these models also appear on my Top Rated Chainsaw page, which also includes electric and battery-operated models.


  But here you will find the best gas chainsaw for your money.


  #### Before buying a gas chainsaw:


  #### Check the durability


  You should be able to trust that your chainsaw will withstand heavy use for extended periods. Cutting wood places considerable wear on the cutting mechanism and saw components, so it must be able to withstand abuse.


  #### Research the brand


  Husqvarna makes some of the most powerful and reliable chainsaws on the market. Remington also makes a versatile and versatile model that handles light to medium jobs with no problems.

  Chainsaws from these manufacturers generally offer excellent value for money plus the reliability advantage that comes from an established brand.


  #### Deciding the size of the bar


  Choosing the right bar size for your needs is essential to getting the most out of your chainsaw. Short bars are usually easier to handle, but longer bars have less movement in the event of a kickback, making them possibly safer.


  For home use, a chainsaw with a bar length of 12 to 14 inches is probably sufficient, but be prepared to climb up to 20 inches for larger jobs.


  #### Figure weight limit


  Your chainsaw should have enough mass so that you can cut the wood efficiently, but it shouldn't be so heavy that it is difficult to handle. It's also a good idea to get a saw that you can handle fairly easily with one hand if needed for maintenance work.


  #### Decide the type of fuel and engine


  Gasoline chain saws with internal combustion engines typically provide the most power and are best suited for heavy-duty jobs. For light trimmings and general gardening, a good battery-powered model should suffice.

  For maintenance work, you could be much better with a cordless chainsaw that does not smoke and does not require gas, take a look at the Makita electric chainsaw.


  #### Consider the price


  Chainsaws don't necessarily have to be expensive to deliver reliable performance. Many of the models reviewed here offer a good compromise between power, performance, and affordability.

  Choose your chainsaw based on your intended applications and you should be able to find one that fits your budget.


  #### Conclusion


  While gas chainsaws are much louder compared to electric options, they generally offer much better performance. So these are quite popular with professional lumberjacks and you can find plenty of options out there. Therefore, we have mentioned some of the best options in this article along with their differences and a detailed buying guide- mentioned above. But, if you're still confused and can't find the perfect gas chainsaw, here are some of our recommendations:


  * If you want a very powerful gas chainsaw, you can go for the GreenWorks 20362 gas chainsaw. Based on its name, it comes with a large 24-inch cutting blade that is much larger than other options present in this item. And this blade is driven by a 60.3 DC motor which is quite powerful for most users. Since Husqvarna is a highly reputable brand, you also get excellent build quality and a 2-year warranty period.


  * While Makita 12" Oregon Chain Saw is a lesser-known brand of power tools and chains, the Jonsered CS2245 Gas Chainsaw is the most reliable and durable option featured in this article. This is because, in addition to offering excellent build quality, you also get a 4-year warranty on this chainsaw. And since it has an 18-inch blade size that is powered by a 45DC motor, you get a great balance between size and performance.


  * However, if you are on a budget and want an affordable gas chainsaw option then go for the Poulan 14-inch gas chainsaw. Since it is a remanufactured chainsaw and not a new product, it is priced significantly lower. It comes with a 33DC motor that is quite powerful for its given compact size. And the compact size and lightweight body of this gas chainsaw make it a great option if you travel a lot with your chainsaw.
    I hope this thoughtful article will help you in choosing the best gas chainsaw.

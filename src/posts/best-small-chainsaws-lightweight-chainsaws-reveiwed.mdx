  A good chainsaw can help increase your productivity and efficiency. This is
  why we have developed this guide on the best small chainsaw options for you to
  find the one that you are looking for with ease. Understandably, it's a lot
  quieter than any other gas chainsaw. No need for anything or any fumes. It
  begins as smoothly as you like. But where can you get such an option? Here’s
  where:


  The top pick of the range has a 6300rpm brushless motor. And with this EGO power+ method, you can do most jobs. This is the [WEN 40417](https://www.amazon.com/WEN-40417-Lithium-Brushless-Chainsaw/dp/B0711Z1VSX). It is perfect for any day's use!

products:
  - name: Worx WG303.1
    specs:
      - name: Size
        value: 9.4 x 8.1 x 25.2 inches

      For pruning branches into desired parts, the corded electric black decker
      lopper chainsaw is fine. With its clamping jaws, it grabs every piece and
      then slices in one quick move. Also, if you use this one, you get to leave
      work early. Since it provides branches and logs with rapid cutting.


      It's a pretty safe saw to use, most importantly. It has a rough metal guard that protects its sharp jaws. Since the guard snaps back over the blade as soon as you finish cutting, you remain healthy.


      Additionally, with this one, you get an auto chain tensioning device. And it's hardly a challenge to oil the machine. You can, however, also use vegetable oil.


      The two handles are one thing we loved about the saw. This enables you to carry the saw with both hands, offering additional comfort.


      #### Verdict


      The saw will not fatigue you much as it cuts in one quick motion. You can essentially cut most materials using a 4.5 amp motor to power the saw. No batteries are needed! That will allow you not to think about replacing any batteries. A major benefit is the auto chain tensioning system. The slitting capacity of up to 4 inches.
    pros:
      - Easy to use. No ambiguity in the way it operates
      - You may use an extended cord for long-distance coverage.
      - Cutting quickly through dense branches
      - Does not annoy you with unnecessary noise
    cons:
      - We couldn't find anything to add here really. Apart from the bottle of
        oil which comes with it. But of course, that is not part of the issue
        with the saw.

      The XCU02Z comes with an Oregon chain, which is excellent for pruning and
      limbing. All the strength you would find in a tiny chainsaw is
      lightweight, balanced, and most importantly.


      A nice addition you would like is the "tool-less" chain change as well. Without having any fancy instrument at all the chain is adapted.

      If you're a novice, the XCU02Z is an excellent option. It is also a much safer instrument, in addition to its ease of use. The chain comes to a very swift stop as soon as you let go of the trigger.


      With this one, you can even climb up a tree. Also, one-hand use is certainly not outside the spectrum of capabilities either. The switch is a one-slide. So, you slide the button on the saw to trigger it and you don't have to apply pressure to keep the saw going.


      For that individual who needs to get it correct to the nail, the saw is perfect. Its cutting accuracy is outstanding.


      This is a great saw that will not wake your neighbor up. It barely makes any noise at all, unlike a gas saw. Furthermore, it does not produce some form of scent as many other saws do.


      #### **Verdict**


      Driven by two batteries of lithium ions for long hours. The guide bar is 12 inches long. Makita developed a 1650 FPM chain velocity motor to cut through. Fewer chain changes make maintenance simpler for the instrument.
    pros:
      - Simple as well as convenient to use
      - The cordless device allows you to bring it with you everywhere. You can
        go fishing, too, and get cut
      - Zero emissions (you should enjoy this profit better!)
      - The batteries will never be a concern, as you can adjust them when
        necessary.
      - Due to the 12" guide bar, an improved cutting skill
      - Perfect top handle for limbing or pruning
    cons:
      - One issue that bothers a lot of users is the drops in the chain. You
        might find yourself having to change the chain more often than you want.
      - Although the handle is outstanding, there is still space for enhanced
        grip.
      - The tension adjuster also comes under the "needs improvement" category
        (mainly because it feels weak in plastic).

      It was also possible to equate the Makita UC4051A electric chain saw with
      a similar size gas saw. You wouldn't mind using it over any of the gas
      saws.


      It has a regular Oregon chain. The UC4051A has a chain speed of 2900 FMP, designed for quick and successful cutting! That's all the speed of the chain you need.


      The rubberized grip handles and big trigger turn will make you feel relaxed. Also, to cover long distances, you can add a large extended cord. The saw would run without any visible power loss.


      Even though a small chainsaw is a heavy tool, it is much smaller and easier to handle than a gas chainsaw. We wouldn't suggest that you climb any tree (holding the saw with one hand) with this one.


      You shouldn't look much further than this screw to render light to medium cuts. But for cutting heavier objects, a gas saw would be ideal. A whopping 2,900 FPM chain speed offers fast and furious cuts.


      #### Verdict 


      Find more consistency and feel relaxed holding the rubberized grip handles. Built-in current limiter to stop burnout. Stay safe with the UC4051A electric chain brake that has

      - Reduced risk of burnout due to cutter limiter.
      - The cutting pace is rather unrivaled.
      - Reduced maintenance.
      - Excellent productivity
    cons:
      - Heavy for a tiny chainsaw
      - Improvement of the necessary chain mechanism

      In addition to the comfortable handles, it has a brake chain to stop the
      chain instantly, particularly in the event of any kickback. Also, when you
      release the button, the chain stops nearly immediately.

      The automatic oiler ensures that you never need to panic a lot. This device provides not only the chain but also the bar with continuous lubrication. With the assistance of the auto-tension system, proper tension is also ensured.

      You don't have to continually remove the cap to see the oil level, unlike in many other small chainsaws. Instead, it has a transparent window for you to see. That's pretty convenient when you're in a frenzy.

      The saw comes with a 16-inch bar and offers enough strength to work long hours as well.


      #### Verdict


      As it has both a tool-free chain replacement system and an auto tensioning system, this saw will reduce your headaches. For you, the auto oiler feature will do just that.

    cons:
      - A bit too much bar oil is needed.
      - The saw may not be locked in place. For certain users, this may be
        inconvenient.
    pros:
      - "Got enough authority to do the job of a gas chainsaw. "
      - With its friendly style, it's very easy to maneuver.
      - Safety features will keep you safe from any unnecessary harm.

      a 14-inch bar. It has both strength and longevity in a strong mix. You'd
      love to work around your house and even in large woods.

      Then the saw is powered by batteries that last for a very long time. The batteries, however, are also interchangeable. Moreover, the battery pack comes with a self-maintenance feature.

      The 455 Rancher chainsaw made by Husqvarna comes with a massive 20" bar
      length." The saw is powered by gas and has all the energy to break large
      logs into smaller parts. Also, firewood is in her grasp for pruning,
      limbing, and cutting.


      455 Rancher has a few special features that you can look forward to. A device of centrifugal air cleaning for air injection is something to appreciate. As it prevents larger debris from accessing the air filter, this device guarantees a long-lasting engine life.


      Again in this scene, power is truly something to remember. For those people who demand a high-powered, heavy-duty cutting saw, this is just the perfect saw. Also, this is the sort of saw that can be used every day.


      This one has a compression button, unlike many gas-powered chainsaws, which makes an easy start possible. Even when you are working, change your chains easily because it has a side-mounted chain tensioning mechanism.


      #### Verdict


      Increased satisfaction with the anti-vibration system. Less vibration, more clean cuts. 20 inches in length can prove to be successful when cutting large trees. To facilitate your maintenance job, an automatic chain oiler is present.

      A 40V cordless chainsaw with a 16-inch handle is provided by Green Works.
      Another impressive green work saw that comes with enormous weight and a
      lithium-ion battery. This one weighs just around 7 lbs (remember that this
      is just the saw's weight).

      The saw's brushless method makes it truly a worthy one to make this list. It guarantees a long-running time with high efficiency as well as successful cutting. Also, it allows for greater longevity. It has all the security features that you would hope for. The most prominent one is the chain brake. You don't have to think about getting kickbacks all that much.

      The battery lasts long enough to allow up to 100 cuts per charge to be made. Charging time is also not that long either. A 2.0amp battery, for example, can take an hour to charge.

      For softer and smaller trees, this device is recommended. Not so ideal, however for felling or cutting hardwood.


      #### Verdict


      A brushless device that offers a long service life. You'll stay free of worries longer. Comfortable to use, since it produces low vibration and less noise. It comes with a break for the safety chain to keep you safer. The saw features an automatic oiler as well. Without any devices, chain tensioning is also feasible. That reduces hardship for you!

  ### Buying Guide


  To guide we have evaluated each option to the best of our ability to make sure you can choose with ease. Here are other things you must notice:


  #### How to find the most comfortable option:


  All you need to do is make sure the saw doesn't overheat and that it's still sharp. It also offers a strong range of safety features, including built-in safety chain brakes, to go along with its convenient use. Speaking of comfortable, it will be pretty comfortable to hang onto the rubber rear and front handle. A powerful 14.5 amp motor will make all the cuts as smooth as you would like.


  #### Top features to look at:


  The automatic chain oiler makes maintenance much simpler for you. Smooth start-ups at any moment. For months, you can have the saw idle and still start perfectly. Both blade and chain changes are less of a tool and more comfortable options.


  #### Important notice:


  We have no idea what kind of job you're going to be doing with a chainsaw. So, note that while this list is focused on hours of study, you are the only one who can determine for yourself the perfect small chainsaw!

      1. CMXGSAMA421S Craftsman


      Operationally, this gas chain saw is very strong. It's supplied with a capable engine. Perfect for a smooth and seamless experience, it offers everything you'd need.


      2. Poulan Pro PR4016


      The PR4016 from Poulan is a very good choice that can be easily mistaken due to its construction for a much cheaper saw but is a very good and inexpensive model. In terms of strength, comfort, value, and durability, it is built to be capable.


      3. X-BULL 20-Inch Chain Saw Operated by Gas


      It comes with some amazing characteristics that take away a lot of excessive load from both the user and the engine itself. This is one of the more expensive mini gas chainsaws that you can purchase, but in terms of functionality, it does not give a lot.


      4. 120 Mark II Husqvarna Chainsaw


      Husqvarna chainsaw is designed to start with a single pull quickly, this chain saw is user-friendly and developed with kickback prevention. This is a 46cc, two-cycle chainsaw powered by gas that is sufficiently consistent to generate a lot of torque to perform heavy employment.


      5. Poulan Pro PR5020 20-inch Gas Chain Saw


      The inclusion of the OxyPower motor in this chain saw will allow its consumer with high-potential to make the cuts more accurately and also consumes less fuel. It is a gas-powered 58cc two-stroke that uses less gasoline.
    ques: Who makes the best small gas chainsaw?
  - ans: In general, it is more difficult to handle a chainsaw with a cutting bar
      longer than 20 inches than a smaller chainsaw and is intended for
      industrial and technical use.
    ques: Do I get a chainsaw that's 18 or 20 inches?
  - ques: What chainsaw brand is the best?
    ans: Husqvarna and Stihl are generally considered to be the world's two best
      manufacturers of chainsaws. Any brand is likely to provide almost every
      other consumer brand on the market with superior results. Some prefer a
      Stihl's torque and low maintenance, whereas others prefer a Husqvarna’s
      rigidity and long-running period.
  - ques: Can I put on my chainsaw with a shorter bar?
    ans: Yeah, but you need a bar that's made to match the saw. But because most of
      the saws have longer bars than they need, a shorter one is hard to go
      wrong. You can get more leverage and if the bar is shorter, it is easier
      to keep the chain out of the dirt and in contact with different obstacles.
